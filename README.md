# deepfake-detection-project
Our project aims to develop a machine learning model to compare and contrast images sourced from Flickr, a platform with user-uploaded photographs, against those generated by ThisPersonDoesNotExist, which uses generative adversarial networks (GANs) to create lifelike human images. We'll evaluate the nuances in authenticity and qaulity
